# Repetitive execution

**Loops** are used to repeat a specific block of code.

<br>

Structure of the **for loop**:

```{r, eval=F}
for(i in vector_expression){
    action_command
}
```

3 main elements:
* **i** is the loop variable: it is updated at each iteration.
* **vector_expression**: value attributed to **i** at each iteration (the number of iterations is the **length of vector_expression**).
* **action_command**: what action to take at each iteration.

Note the usage of **curly brakets {}** to start and end the loop!

* Example:

```{r}
for(i in 2:5){
	# prints the value of i at each iteration
	print(i)
	# multiplies i by 2 at each iteration
	y <- i*2
	# prints the value of y at each iteration
	print(y)
}
```

* Example of a **for loop** that iterates over a character vector:

```{r}
# Character vector
myfruits <- c("apple", "pear", "grape")

# The for loop prints the current element j, and the number of characters of element j
for(j in myfruits){
	print(j)
	print(nchar(j))
}
```

* Example of a **for loop** that iterates over each row of a matrix, and prints the minimum value of that row :

```{r}
# Matrix of 50 rows, 16 columns 
mymat <- matrix(rnorm(800), 
	nrow=50)
	
# For loop over mymat rows
	# 1:nrow(mymat): ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the matrix: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...., 48, 49, 50
	
for(i in 1:nrow(mymat)){
	# prints the value of i at each iteration
	print(i)
	# prints the minimum value of the ith row of mymat at each iteration
	print(min(mymat[i,]))
}
```

* **If statement** in **For loop**:

You can combine **for loops** and **if statements**:

```{r, eval=F}
# Matrix
mymat <- matrix(rnorm(800), 
        nrow=50)
	
# Loop over rows of mymat and print row if its median value is > 0
for(i in 1:nrow(mymat)){
	# extract the current row
	rowi <- mymat[i,]
	# if median of row is > 0, print row
	if(median(rowi) > 0){
		print(rowi)
	}
}
```
