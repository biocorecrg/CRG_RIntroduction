## [Introduction to R Studio](rstudio.md)

We will use the [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) of the CRG server (http://rstudio.linux.crg.es). We will go through what can be done with R Studio, from file and folder manipulation/navigation, to getting help on R functions.

## [Basics of R](Rbasics.md): syntax, create an object, manipulate the object, simple arithmetics.

## [Functions usage in R](functionsbasics.md)
Arguments. Get help.
   
## [R scripts](Rscripts.md): write and save commands, run them as a block. Comment code.
    
## [Data types](datatype.md)
    
## [Data structures](datastructure.md)
Vectors
Basic (and most important) data structure in R. We will learn how to create, modify, subset, manipulate, compare vectors.
